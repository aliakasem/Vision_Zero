### Abstract

This analysis will primarily focus on the number of collisions before and after NYC adopting  Vision Zero. In this analysis, the statistical model of K-S testing will be used to compare the two periods;  before and after the adoption of Vision Zero. The study will include a time series of the effectiveness of Vision Zero using the data; based on the cumulative number of accidents. The cumulative number and daily pattern of the collisions will measure probabilities of effectiveness. 

### Declaring the null hypothesis 
For Traffic Analysis and Pattern in relation to the adoption of Vision Zero in terms of the cumulative number of accidents prior to the adoption of Vision Zero,  which the data frame begins from 2012 and the Vision Zero starts on January 15, 2015.  Null Hypothesis: is testing the probability of daily accidents in term of the adopting improvements.  Using the K-S testing to test if the null hypothesis is true. Also, the hypothesis will test the time series to reflect the changes in the number of accidents throughout the five Boroughs.
